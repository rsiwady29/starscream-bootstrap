Starscream Bootstrap
====================

The goal of this project is to reduce time when using [Acklen Avenue's Starscream](https://github.com/AcklenAvenue/Starscream) Boilerplate.

Demo: http://starscream-bootstrap.herokuapp.com/

How?
=== 
The boilerplate/template by itself is awesome, but when you start a new project you always get into the tedious task of renaming and customizing the files and content to match accordingly with your project's name. And let's face it this task is error prone. Forgetting to renaming something is really easy.

So I decided to create this app to help you(and me) save great amount of time and work. The app will automate the process of renaming files, folders, projects source (namespaces, references) and other necessary files so you can start developing your application right away. Isn't it cool? 


Under the hood
===
This app uses nodejs with packages like express, wrench and node native zip. 
It also uses Yeoman with the angular generator to provide a great workflow for the front-end.

- This project could really find Unit tests useful.
- If you find any [issues](https://github.com/rsiwady29/starscream-bootstrap/issues) please report them and/or submit a pull request with the fix.

Happy Coding!
